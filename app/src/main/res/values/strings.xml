Active abilities are used by dragging a card toward an enemy target. Passive abilities are used by dragging a card toward an ally. To use a passive on the card itself, drag it outwards and then bring it back. After all your cards have performed one of these abilities, your turn ends and the other player\'s turn begins. The Rage bar fills up gradually each turn. When it is full, a flame icon will appear. Drag the flame onto a card to use its Ultimate Ability.  The player who eliminates all opponent cards first wins.  Long press on a card to see its info, including health, damage, abilities, traits, and active effects. Traits are permanent abilities that influence the game. Status effects can be beneficial or harmful and have a duration that decreases every turn. Tap an effect\'s name in the info sheet to see exactly what it does.</string>
